# Exegesis Tutorial

This is a tutorial which will teach you how to create an OpenAPI 3.0.0 document,
and host it with Exegesis on node.js.

## OpenAPI

To start with, this is the simplest OpenAPI 3.0.0 document you can write:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: My API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
```

The `openapi: 3.0.1` part tells us this is an OpenAPI document, and conforms
to [version 3.0.1](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md)
of the spec.

This has all the required fields to be an OpenAPI document, and will pass
validation, but as API documents go, this one is pretty boring.  It doesn't
acually do anything.  Let's fix that by adding a route:

```yaml
openapi: 3.0.1
info:
  title: My API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  '/greet':
    get:
      summary: Greets the user
      operationId: getGreeting
      x-exegesis-controller: greetController
      parameters:
        - description: The name of the user to greet.
          name: name
          in: query
          required: true
          schema:
            type: string
      responses:
        200:
          description: A greeting for the user.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                required:
                  - message
                properties:
                  message:
                    type: string
        default:
          description: Unexpected error.
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                required:
                  - message
                properties:
                  message:
                    type: string
```

That's pretty verbose.  Let's break this down into parts.

We've added a new "/greet" to our "paths" section, with a "get" operation.
This means clients can send an HTTP GET to "/greet" to run this operation.  This
operation also has an `operationId` of "getGreeting".  This is a string that
uniquely identifies this operation, across the entire document.  No other
operation is allowed to have this operationId.

There's also one extra special part we've added here:

```yaml
x-exegesis-controller: greetController
```

Anything that starts with an "x-" in an OpenAPI document is called a
"specification extension".  In this case, we're using an
[Exegesis specific extension](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/OAS3%20Specification%20Extensions.md)
to tell Exegesis what JS module contains the code for this controller.

We've added one parameter, the "name" parameter:

```yaml
parameters:
  - description: The name of the user to greet.
    name: name
    in: query
    required: true
    schema:
      type: string
```

This parameter must be present, and must be a string.  Exegesis will generate
a validation error back to the client if this field isn't present, or is the
wrong type.

Finally, we added a responses section:

```yaml
200:
  description: A greeting for the user.
  content:
    application/json:
      schema:
        type: object
        required:
          - message
        properties:
          message:
            type: string
```

This says we can reply with a 200 response, and if we do, the response is going
to be a JSON object with a single property, "message".  There's also a "default"
response, which is what the client can expect if our response is not a 200
response.  You can list as many different response codes here as you wish.

## An Exegesis Server

Now that we have a simple OpenAPI document, we need to have a server which
implements it.  Let's start a new node.js project:

```sh
mkdir exegesis-tutorial
cd exegesis-tutorial
npm init -y
npm install express exegesis-express
```

Save the above OpenAPI document in "exegesis-tutorial" as "openapi.yaml",
then create an index.js file:

```js
const express = require('express');
const exegesisExpress = require('exegesis-express');
const http = require('http');
const path = require('path');

async function createServer() {
    // See https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Options.md
    const options = {
        controllers: path.resolve(__dirname, './controllers'),
        allowMissingControllers: false
    };

    // This creates an exgesis middleware, which can be used with express,
    // connect, or even just by itself.
    const exegesisMiddleware = await exegesisExpress.middleware(
        path.resolve(__dirname, './openapi.yaml'),
        options
    );

    const app = express();

    // If you have any body parsers, this should go before them.
    app.use(exegesisMiddleware);

    // Return a 404
    app.use((req, res) => {
        res.status(404).json({message: `Not found`});
    });

    // Handle any unexpected errors
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
        res.status(500).json({message: `Internal error: ${err.message}`});
    });

    const server = http.createServer(app);

    return server;
}

createServer()
.then(server => {
    server.listen(3000);
    console.log("Listening on port 3000");
    console.log("Try visiting http://localhost:3000/greet?name=Jason");
})
.catch(err => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    process.exit(1);
});
```

## The Controller

This is the boilerplate to get an Exegesis project running, but the exciting
part is the "controller" - this is the code that actually implements our
OpenAPI document.  You may recall in our OpenAPI document we specified:

```yaml
operationId: getGreeting
x-exegesis-controller: greetController
```

So now we need to make a new folder named "controllers", and in that folder
we're going to create a file called "greetController.js":

```js
// This function has the same name as an operationId in the OpenAPI document.
exports.getGreeting = function getGreeting(context) {
    const name = context.params.query.name;
    return {message: `Hello ${name}`};
}
```

This controller is pretty simple - is just reads in the name parameter, and
returns a JSON object.  Controllers can optionally return a Promise, take a
callback as a second parameter, or even just write a response directly
to `context.res`.

The `context` variable here is an ["Exegesis Context"](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Exegesis%20Controllers.md),
which contains lots of [helpful info](https://github.com/exegesis-js/exegesis/blob/master/docs/Exegesis%20Controllers.md#whats-in-a-context)
when you're writing a controller.

## Giving it a Try

Start the server with:

```sh
node index.js
```

Then, try pointing your browser at [http://localhost:3000/greet?name=Jason](http://localhost:3000/greet?name=Jason), and you should see a greeting!
